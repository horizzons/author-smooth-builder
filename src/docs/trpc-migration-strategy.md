# tRPC Migration Strategy

This document outlines our strategy for migrating from our custom `useApi` hook pattern to tRPC.

## Phase 1: Setup (Completed)

- ✅ Basic tRPC server setup
- ✅ Client-side tRPC integration
- ✅ Basic authentication middleware
- ✅ Error handling foundations

## Phase 2: Feature Parity (In Progress)

- ✅ Core API routes migrated to tRPC procedures
- ✅ Custom hooks for tRPC interaction
- ✅ Error handling standardization
- ✅ Toast notification integration

## Phase 3: Migration (Current)

We are following a gradual migration strategy:

### Step 1: Parallel Implementation

- Maintain existing API services and endpoints
- Add tRPC procedures that mirror existing functionality
- Implement new features exclusively with tRPC

### Step 2: Component-by-Component Migration

For each component that uses `useApi`:

1. Create the corresponding tRPC procedure if not already exists
2. Add tests for the tRPC procedure to ensure feature parity
3. Update the component to use tRPC instead of `useApi`
4. Validate the component works as expected
5. Ship the updated component

### Step 3: Cleanup

After all components have been migrated:

1. Mark old services as deprecated with JSDoc comments
2. Add console warnings for deprecated service usage
3. Remove deprecated code after a grace period

## Component Migration Priority

1. **High Priority**
   - Site management components
   - User profile components
   - Authentication-related components

2. **Medium Priority**
   - Dashboard components
   - Content editing components
   - Analytics components

3. **Low Priority**
   - Admin panels
   - Infrequently used features
   - Optional functionality

## Testing Strategy

For each migration:

1. Unit test the tRPC procedure
2. Integration test the component with tRPC
3. E2E test critical user flows

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise:

1. Revert component to use `useApi`
2. Maintain the tRPC procedure for future use
3. Document the issue for future resolution

## Timeline

- **Week 1-2**: High priority components
- **Week 3-4**: Medium priority components
- **Week 5-6**: Low priority components
- **Week 7-8**: Cleanup and final testing

## Success Metrics

We will consider the migration successful when:

- 100% of components use tRPC
- No regressions in functionality
- Improved developer experience (measured via developer survey)
- Reduced API-related bugs (measured via error tracking)
